<p>
	Libraries are designed as buildings of service, whether they are public facing institutions that serve the citizens of a given city, or a private academic institution serving students and researchers to promote ideals of education. Who receives the benefits of these services has been historically dependent on those working within the space and the demographics of librarianship, unfortunately, paint a homogenous picture of the industry. The ALA diversity initiative has no study expressing the demographic data of queer librarians who are currently in the field or are currently members of ALA. Nor is there any demographic information involving librarians who are diagnosed with mental illness. While the lack of information on these aspects of my identity is disappointing, it allows me to look at what I can offer as someone who falls into those categories. For my MLIS I have been studying a variety of things that relate to both of these particular communities. With queerness, I have spent time addressing issues of classification, subject headings, archival representations of historical queer events, and the institutionalization of queer community archives.
</p>
For mental illness, I have spent a significant amount of my research time at UCLA looking at library’s as a physical/theoretical space and dissecting anxiety and alienation within the student population. This research, which can be seen upon this website in the MLIS Portfolio section, is mainly addressing issues of accessibility within the academic space and how often times the mental labor associated with using the library can be unconsciously made worse through things like layout, knowledge geography, and institutional hegemony.
<p>
Beyond my excursions into the theoretical and textual analysis of librarianship, I have spent plenty of time practicing diversity, equity, and inclusion within the spaces that I inhabit. For instance, at UCLA I was the president of OUTReach, an LGBTQ+ organization that helped students invested in queer libraries and archives find resources on and off-campus.
</p>
<p>
The value of all of this is to explain a simple thing: As a white, male-bodied individual I understand what it is like to walk into an institution, whether that be academic or otherwise, and feel somewhat represented through either those who work there or those who use these spaces. However, as a Queer individual and as someone with a mental illness, I understand what it is like to walk into similar spaces and feel alienated from the crowd and materials within. These two existences are unfortunately far apart from each other and my goals as a librarian are in the attempts to close that gap so that students in the future don’t have to deal with the same dissonance that has existed for me in the past. The ideologies of equity, inclusion, and diversity are not ones that I can take lightly because I have to live them.
</p>

	<em>Due to recent events I just want those who go to my website to understand that I fully support the protests, Black Lives Matter, and other similar organizations that are directed at the social and economic justice of Black Americans. The library cannot be a neutral place that avoids discussions about white supremacy and anti-black racism nor can we as librarians view the profession with an awe that eliminates any possibility of questioning motives. We aren't separate from the rest of society so we must work that much harder to make sure that our spaces, programs, and materials represent the world that we live in rather than just a privileged few. </em>	</p>
