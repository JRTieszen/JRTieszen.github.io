										<h1>Advising History</h1>
									</header>
<h2>Fall 2018:</h2><p> During the orientation session for my cohort, I was introduced to my advisor Greg Leazer in an informal group discussion setting. This talk was mainly to get us as students acquainted with our advisor.
<br>
<h2>Winter 2019:</h2> On February 26 of 2019, there was a similar meeting to the previous one in that it was myself and all of the other advisees of Leazer’s. This was a more in-depth discussion on the process of developing the portfolio and how they are assessed by the faculty. There was also a discussion on what to base the issue paper on such as issue advocacy and programming but a majority of this meeting dealt with the actual process of the portfolio.
<br><br>
<h2>2019 - 2020:</h2>
	From this point on all of the meetings that I had with Leazer were either through email or meetings that happened by chance. I always had an idea of what I wanted to pursue with regards to classes so I never particularly felt the need to meet with Leazer all that often. Greg Leazer has been incredibly accommodating though and I have never had any issues connecting with him when I did need to reach out and discuss something.
<br><br>

<h2>Additional Advisor:</h2>
I am currently interning at USC in the VKC library under Andy Rutkowski, who is the visualization specialist there. The advising that I have received from his is professional in nature as he is teaching me a variety of skills related to his specific career from digital skills to allowing me to present my work to other professionals as USC. He has been incredibly supportive within my internship is always open to offering advice or trying to create and offer opportunities for me to gain more practical experience in the field.
